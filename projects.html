			<h3>Electronic Business Card</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><sub>May 22, 2022</sub></p>
				<p>I'm proud to announce my latest project, my electronic business card! It is a 2 layer PCB, based around the ATMega8u2 chip. At the moment I haven't been able to program the USB interface to function properly, but otherwise, I'm proud of how this project turned out! I plan on redesigning it in the near future with better functionality and more cost savings.</p>

			<h3>Personal Website</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><sub>April 20, 2022</sub></p>
				<p>The purpose of this project was to design the frontend of a website in HTML and CSS, and host it on the world wide web to be accessible through any browser. The webpage and menus were designed using <i>Adobe Dreamweaver</i>. This website's directory is hosted on a Windows 10 machine running <i>WAMP</i> (acronym for <i>Windows, Apache, MySQL, and 	PHP</i>), a solution stack for hosting web applications.</p>
				<p>Moving forward, I am interesting on expanding this website to serve primarily as a reference for my personal portfolio, resume, and contact information. The website is still a work in progress, and I plan on refining the UI and site structure for better scalability, as well as implementing a contact form, and playing with databases and other user interfaces.</p>
				<p>In addition, this website's version history is available through <i><a class = "linkColor" href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/nicholas-chavez.com">archive.org</a></i>, by my own periodical snapshot requests. You can view historical snapshots of this website since it was first launched.</p>

			<h1>Project Rocket 2019</h1>

			<p>I prototyped and designed my own model rocket flight computer. I successfully test flown it twice. I recovered and analyzed the data and rom the first flight but I lost the rocket for the second flight.</p>

			<h1>Project Rocket 2022</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>I origiinally started this project in January 2022 as a continuation of my Rocketry antics from the original project rocket in 2019. I anticipated a first test flight of a new launchpad, launch computer, rocket vehicle, and flight computer by April 2022. I have since put this project on hold. I did, however design and build a new, much improved launchpad from project rocket 2019.
