			<h3>Artemis 1 launch coming soonâ„¢</h3>

			<p>Artemis 1 rollout on the 18th, first launch attempt on the 22nd, with subsequent attempts schedueled for the 2nd and the 5h of september. At least 100k+ visitors expected by the space coast office of tourism. Going to try to see the rollout if possible. HYPE!!!</p>

			<h3>Removed some dead social media links</h3>
			<hr>
			<p><sub>July 7th, 2022</sub></p>
			<p>Tonight I decided to remove some social media links that were originally on the footer of this website, namely Instagram and Facebook, as I've since deleted my accounts on those services since I never found myself using them much.</p>

			<h3>RF Communication Demo</h3>
			<hr>
			<p><sub>May 15, 2022</sub></p>
			<p>Today I was working on another technology demonstration, one-way RF communications using the NRF24L01 modules, interfacing with Arduino. The devices communicate on the 2.5 GHz ISM band, with pressing the button on the device on the left transmitting a btye, and the device on the right listening for a specific byte on the specified frequency. The NRF24L01 modules transmit using gaussian frequency shift keying, or GSFK. In the future I plan on implementing a bidirectional telemetry link for transmitting sensor data and sending and receiving commands for my next generation of rocket avionics.</p>

			<h3>3D Printed Rocket Components</h3>
			<hr>
			<p><sub>May 9, 2022</sub></p>
			<p>I'm currently experimenting with 3D printing structural components for my rocketry projects. I've made an almost 1:1 copy of a commercial 33mm conical nosecone. The commercial styrene part is still 55% lighter than my 3D Printed PLA part, however playing with infill and wall thickness could probably lower this number substantially. I'm really pleased with the print quality. I plan on 3D Printing most if not all of the structural parts for my future rocketry projects.</p>

			<h3>Introducing the Archive section</h3>
			<hr>
			<p><sub>May 4, 2022</sub></p>
			<p>I've went ahead and designed an archive section for this website, this is the best place to see all my past projects prior to the launching of this website. I think it gives visitors to my website a good idea of what my interests and technical skills are.</p>

			<h3>Design Overhaul</h3>
			<hr>
			<p><sub>May 2, 2022</sub></p>
			<p>I've completely overhauled the visual design and UI of my website. After hours of painstaking prototyping and shuffling through decades-old stackexchange posts, it finally works properly. Using the CSS <i>flex</i> property, and some clever use of classes, I was able to make a sticky footer that properly scales with the content of this site. In addition, I've learned to use the CSS <i>@media</i> query to scale the header of this site for mobile devices. Lastly, I added a cool background image to complement this site's accent colors. It's one of my custom circuit board designs! In the extremely near future I plan on adding an "archive" section to this site, where I can put all of the projects I've built throughout high school before this site was launched.</p>

			<h3>Hosting changed</h3>
			<hr>
			<p><sub>April 29, 2022</sub></p>
			<p>I've decided to end the experiment of hosting this website from my own windows machine. It was very interesting to learn more about servers and web hosting, but it was simply impractical for uptime. I'm now hosting this website through GoDaddy's servers, which is far more reliable. I've also taken advantage of a very handy dreamweaver feature that lets you directly update the server's files through FTP. </p>

			<h3>Nicholas-chavez.com is launched</h3>
			<hr>
			<p><sub>April 20, 2022</sub></p>
			<p>I'm proud to announce my personal website is now live and hosted on a functional server. This is a good milestone for me and a great benchmark of my programming skills, as this website was designed myself in HTML and CSS, using Adobe Dreamweaver.</p>
